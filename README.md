Blue Y2K inspired minimalist survey template

USAGE
- download the repository
- customize template by replacing "option#" and "#option#" as seen fit
- make a copy of this [sheet](url)
- go to [SheetDB](url) and create a free API using the sheet link (make sure sheet is set to give anyone viewing access)
- copy the generated API endpoint url and replace "INSERT YOUR API LINK" in the html file
- your form should now record responses to that sheet!

NOTE
- if changing the column headers in the sheet template, make sure to also change the name values in the input elements of the html file
